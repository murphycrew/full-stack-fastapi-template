# This workflow has been disabled because it's specific to the FastAPI organization
# and requires a PROJECTS_TOKEN secret that doesn't exist in user repositories.
#
# Original workflow attempted to add PRs and issues to:
# https://github.com/orgs/fastapi/projects/2
#
# To re-enable for your own project board, you would need to:
# 1. Create a Personal Access Token with 'project' scope
# 2. Add it as PROJECTS_TOKEN secret
# 3. Update the project-url to your own project board
