5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: How should admin roles be assigned and managed? ‚Üí A: Both user-level admin privileges and database-level application roles for maintenance
- Q: What should happen when the system detects undeclared user-owned models? ‚Üí A: Use base class inheritance, fail CI for undeclared owner_id models, provide override mechanism
- Q: What types of background operations need RLS bypass capability? ‚Üí A: Maintenance and read-only reporting/analytics
- Q: How should users be notified when RLS prevents data access? ‚Üí A: Generic "Access denied" message or same as current application-level errors
- Q: How should the system handle existing data when RLS is first enabled? ‚Üí A: Base classes provide owner_id field, RLS enforcement starts immediately
- Q: Should RLS management be API-driven or purely internal infrastructure? ‚Üí A: Purely internal infrastructure - no user-facing API endpoints needed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building a multi-user application, I want automatic database-level data isolation so that users can only access their own data without relying on application-level security checks that could be bypassed or forgotten.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user-scoped data model exists, **When** a regular user attempts to access data, **Then** they can only see and modify data they own
2. **Given** a user-scoped data model exists, **When** a read-only admin accesses data, **Then** they can view all data but cannot modify any records
3. **Given** a user-scoped data model exists, **When** a full admin accesses data, **Then** they can view and modify all data across all users
4. **Given** RLS is enabled, **When** a developer creates a new model with owner_id field, **Then** the CI system automatically detects it and fails the build with guidance
5. **Given** a user-scoped model exists, **When** a user attempts to create data with incorrect ownership, **Then** the system prevents the creation at the database level
6. **Given** RLS is disabled, **When** users access data, **Then** all existing application-level security continues to work unchanged
7. **Given** this is a template project, **When** developers use the template, **Then** they see working examples of RLS-enabled models (like the Item model)
8. **Given** the existing Item model, **When** RLS is enabled, **Then** it automatically becomes user-scoped and demonstrates the RLS functionality

### Edge Cases
- **User Deletion**: When a user is deleted, their data remains but becomes inaccessible to all users except database-level admin roles. CASCADE delete policies prevent orphaned data.
- **Background Jobs**: Background jobs must explicitly set admin context for maintenance operations. Jobs without admin context will be restricted by RLS policies.
- **Policy Corruption**: Misconfigured or corrupted RLS policies will cause database errors. The system provides policy validation and repair mechanisms.
- **Admin Privilege Loss**: When admin users lose elevated privileges, they revert to regular user context and can only access their own data.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a base class that developers can inherit to declare models as user-scoped with automatic RLS enforcement
- **FR-001B**: System MUST ensure the user-scoped base class provides the owner_id field and proper foreign key relationship to user.id
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically enforce data isolation at the database level for models inheriting from the user-scoped base class
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide user-level read-only admin privileges that can view all data but cannot modify records
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide user-level full admin privileges that can view and modify all user data
- **FR-004B**: System MUST provide database-level application roles for maintenance operations that can bypass RLS
- **FR-005**: System MUST fail CI when models have owner_id fields but don't inherit from the user-scoped base class
- **FR-005B**: System MUST provide override mechanism to explicitly exclude models from RLS requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent users from accessing data they don't own at the database level
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow configuration to enable/disable RLS enforcement system-wide (via environment variables, not API)
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce strict RLS policies that cannot be bypassed by privileged database roles when configured
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically create and manage database security policies through migrations
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain existing application behavior when RLS is disabled
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide generic "Access denied" error messages or maintain consistency with existing application-level security errors when RLS prevents data access (internal error handling, not API)
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow background processes to explicitly set admin context for maintenance and read-only reporting/analytics operations
- **FR-013**: System MUST update existing template models (like Item) to demonstrate RLS functionality as working examples
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear documentation and examples showing how to declare models as user-scoped in the template
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure template users can immediately see RLS in action with the provided example models
- **FR-016**: System MUST create both a regular user and an admin user during initial setup for RLS demonstration
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide configuration for initial user credentials (regular user email/password, admin user email/password)
- **FR-018**: System MUST create database roles for application operations and maintenance operations during setup

### Key Entities
- **UserScopedBase**: A base class that models inherit from to automatically enable RLS enforcement with owner_id field
- **User-Scoped Model**: A data model that inherits from UserScopedBase and requires automatic isolation enforcement
- **RLS Policy**: Database-level security rule that restricts data access based on user identity
- **Admin Context**: Elevated access mode that allows viewing or modifying all user data (both user-level and database-level)
- **Identity Context**: Per-request information about the current user and their access level
